This repository contains a collection of paper discussions on basic computer vision concepts. Each week, we discuss a different paper and go over its main ideas and contributions.

# Week 1: VGG Paper Discussion
During week 1, we delved into the VGG paper and examined its significant contributions to the field of computer vision. The following topics were covered:

The motivation behind the VGG architecture
The components of the VGG architecture
The impact of the VGG architecture on the field of computer vision

# Week 2: ResNet Paper Discussion
In week 2, we discussed the ResNet paper and its impact on the field of computer vision. The following topics were covered:

The motivation behind the ResNet architecture
The components of the ResNet architecture
The impact of the ResNet architecture on the field of computer vision
We hope that this collection of paper discussions provides useful insights and perspectives on fundamental concepts in computer vision.
